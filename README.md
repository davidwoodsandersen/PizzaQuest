##Elevator Pitch:

For people who like pizza and want to explore the world of pizza options in NYC.
Pizza Quest is an app that helps users locate pizza places, review them
and show off how many places they’ve visited to the other users.
Unlike other food locator apps, Pizza Quest gives users a sense of accomplishment
as they work towards completing their quest of becoming
the greatest pizza eater in the city.


##HOW PIZZA QUEST APP WORKS

Users sign up and begin their pizza quest in NYC. Once signed in, on their dashboard
they get a list of all nearby pizza places. A user picks a pizza place,
and this generates a visit on their profile. They can also write a review.
Each place has a point value assigned based on google api ratings/rating count/and or location.
Users will have their names and scores displayed on the leaderboard page.
On the main page there is a top ten list of people who have scored the most
points/gotten the farthest on their pizza quest.



##User
-As a user I want to be able to add a new pizza place to my profile
-As a user I want to track which pizza places I have been to
-As a user I want to see my points accumulate as I eat at more places
-As a user I want to see the top pizza eaters
-As a user I want to be able to search for pizza places by location/rating?
-As a user I want to see a list of my reviews


##MVP
-User Authentication functionality. Users can create a new visit, edit it, destroy it.
Search for pizza places, display point value for pizza place,
be able to add that pizza place to a user’s list of visited places.
Once added, the point value of the pizza place will be added/displayed
to the user’s profile. Display ranking of all users.
