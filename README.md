###Elevator Pitch:

For people who like pizza and want to explore the world of pizza options in NYC,
PizzaQuest is an app that helps users locate pizza places,
and show off how many places they’ve visited to other users.
Unlike other food locator apps, PizzaQuest gives users a sense of accomplishment
as they work towards completing their quest of becoming
the greatest pizza eater in the city.

###How PizzaQuest Works

Users sign up and begin their pizza quest. Once signed in, on their dashboard
they get a map marked with all nearby pizza places. A user selects a pizza place they have visited and this generates a visit on their profile. They can also write a review.
Each place has a point value assigned based on google api ratings/rating count/and/or location.
Users will have their names and scores displayed on the leaderboard page.
On the main page there is a top ten list of users who have scored the most
points/gotten the farthest on their pizza quest.
